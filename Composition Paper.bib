  abstract = {Since at least Cicero, we have known that ``money is the sinew of war.'' Is it possible for a political economy of security (PES) subfield to contribute knowledge beyond Cicero\&apos;s claim? This article aims to delineate the boundaries of a PES subfield by using the classic ``guns versus butter'' trade-off to define the existing literature within the subfield. Thinking seriously about this trade-off, including conditions under which a trade-off may not exist, raises a host of questions. The two most direct questions are: How does consuming ``guns'' influence the consumption of ``butter''? And how does using ``guns'' influence the consumption of ``butter''?},
